# ferroelectric-modelling
Modelling of ferroelectric-dielectric composite materials using human-machine interactive learning. A ferroelectric numerical model has theoretically been improved in two aspects, following the machine learning concept of 'transfer learning. A deep learning (DL) framework is developed to learn from a simulated database and an experimental database. The trained deep learning model and the developed theoretical model are employed in a human-machine interactive learning cycle, where a human researcher refines theoretical model parameters according to the DL predictions, thus improving the modelling accuracy.

The experimental BST composite dataset collected from literature can be found in literature_data directory.
